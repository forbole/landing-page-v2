  "cosmosContent1": "Cosmos is the Internet of blockchains. The first of these blockchains is Cosmos Hub. The primary token of the Cosmos Hub is the ATOM, but Cosmos Hub will support more tokens in the future.",
  "cosmosContent2": "Cosmos Hub has set an example what a hub is about: hub is a connector between different blockchains. We will need more hubs as the network grows larger. ATOM is like a license to contribute to the security and governance of the Cosmos Hub.",
  "cosmosContent3": "The common misconception is that Cosmos is a blockchain. Cosmos is an ecosystem of the Internet of blockchains. This is Cosmos Hub which is the blockchain. When people say “we are validating Cosmos”, what they really mean is “we are validating of Cosmos Hub”."
